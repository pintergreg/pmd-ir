This stuff might seem awesome for the first glance, but actually the used libraries and tools, that made it possible to create PMD IR are awesome. In order of usage:
PMD for the Java static code analizing
Sinatra
Haml
http://prismjs.com/index.html for the source viewer, syntax highlighting, line numbering and marking
